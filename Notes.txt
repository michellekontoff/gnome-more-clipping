BONESSS

GNOME
 eventually left-side sideburns may need more adjustment but so far looking good!! may also want to adjust forehead a leeetle bit but could also just be that gnome heads dont like ballerina buns

gemstone droplet hair is.... we'll see what happens on the other races. but the hair itself may need an adjustment :(

need to look into what's going on at the neck? ramhorns and innkeep braid are good hairs to test. they both curve into the neck a lot for some reason... this may be a problem on the hairs tho... might be a weighting issue???

test braided bunches scalp issues.

Need to be edited on the HAIR level:
Probably have to be done on a per-race basis ;-;
